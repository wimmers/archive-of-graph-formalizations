This theory defines the notion of a partial shortest path tree in the locale @{text psp_tree}.
A partial shortest path tree contains the s nearest notes with respect to some weight function.
Since, at the time of writing, the definition of @{const forest} only guarantees acyclicity
and the definition of @{const tree} is also incorrect by extension, we develop our own definition
of a directed tree in the locale @{text directed_tree}.

section \<open>Directed tree\<close>

text \<open>
The following locale defines the notion of a rooted directed tree. The tree property is
established by asserting a unique walk from the root to each vertex. Note that we need
@{const pre_digraph.awalk} and not @{const pre_digraph.apath} here since we want to have only one 
incoming arc for each vertex. In the locale all the usual properties of trees are established, e.g.
non-existence of @{const pre_digraph.cycle}, absence of loops with @{locale loopfree_digraph} and 
multi-arcs with @{locale nomulti_digraph}.
We also prove the admissibility of an induction rule for finite trees which constructs any tree
inductively by starting with a single node (the root) and consecutively adding leaves.
Finally we define the depth of a tree.
